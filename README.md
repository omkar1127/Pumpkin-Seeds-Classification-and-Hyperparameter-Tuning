Aim:
Pumpkin seeds are frequently consumed as confection worldwide because of their adequate amount of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mineral contents. This study was carried out on the two most important and quality types of pumpkin seeds, ‘‘Urgup_Sivrisi’’(0) and ‘‘Cercevelik’’(1), generally grown in Urgup and Karacaoren regions in Turkey. However, morphological measurements of 2500 pumpkin seeds of both varieties were made possible by using the gray and binary forms of threshold techniques.
